Please take a look at our [plugin documentation](https://ocdi.com/user-guide/) for more information on how to import your demo content.

This plugin is using the modified version of the improved WP import 2.0 that is still in development and can be found here: https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer.

NOTE: There is no setting to "connect" authors from the demo import file to the existing users in your WP site (like there is in the original WP Importer plugin). All demo content will be imported under the current user.

**Do you want to contribute?**

Please refer to our official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/awesomemotive/one-click-demo-import).

== Installation ==

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New',
2. Search for 'One Click Demo Import' and install the plugin,
3. Activate 'One Click Demo Import' from your Plugins page.

**From WordPress.org**

1. Download 'One Click Demo Import'.
2. Upload the 'one-click-demo-import' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate 'One Click Demo Import' from your Plugins page.

**Once the plugin is activated you will find the actual import page in: Appearance -> Import Demo Data.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated the plugin. Where is the "Import Demo Data" page? =

You will find the import page in *wp-admin -> Appearance -> Import Demo Data*.

= Where are the demo import files and the log files saved? =

The files used in the demo import will be saved to the default WordPress uploads directory. An example of that directory would be: `../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/`.

The log file will also be registered in the *wp-admin -> Media* section, so you can access it easily.

= How to predefine demo imports? =

This question is for theme authors. To predefine demo imports, you just have to add the following code structure, with your own values to your theme (using the `ocdi/import_files` filter):

`
function ocdi_import_files() {
	return array(
		array(
			'import_file_name'           => 'Demo Import 1',
			'categories'                 => array( 'Category 1', 'Category 2' ),
			'import_file_url'            => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/demo-content.xml',
			'import_widget_file_url'     => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/widgets.json',
			'import_customizer_file_url' => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/customizer.dat',
			'import_redux'               => array(
				array(
					'file_url'    => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/redux.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name',
				),
			),
			'import_preview_image_url'   => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/preview_import_image1.jpg',
			'import_notice'              => __( 'After you import this demo, you will have to setup the slider separately.', 'your-textdomain' ),
			'preview_url'                => 'http://www.your_domain.com/my-demo-1',
		),
		array(
			'import_file_name'           => 'Demo Import 2',
			'categories'                 => array( 'New category', 'Old category' ),
			'import_file_url'            => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/demo-content2.xml',
			'import_widget_file_url'     => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/widgets2.json',
			'import_customizer_file_url' => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/customizer2.dat',
			'import_redux'               => array(
				array(
					'file_url'    => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/redux.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name',
				),
				array(
					'file_url'    => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/redux2.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name_2',
				),
			),
			'import_preview_image_url'   => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/preview_import_image2.jpg',
			'import_notice'              => __( 'A special note for this import.', 'your-textdomain' ),
			'preview_url'                => 'http://www.your_domain.com/my-demo-2',
		),
	);
}
add_filter( 'ocdi/import_files', 'ocdi_import_files' );
`

You can set content import, widgets, customizer and Redux framework import files. You can also define a preview image, which will be used only when multiple demo imports are defined, so that the user will see the difference between imports. Categories can be assigned to each demo import, so that they can be filtered easily. The preview URL will display the "Preview" button in the predefined demo item, which will open this URL in a new tab and user can view how the demo site looks like.

= How to automatically assign "Front page", "Posts page" and menu locations after the importer is done? =

You can do that, with the `ocdi/after_import` action hook. The code would look something like this:

`
function ocdi_after_import_setup() {
	// Assign menus to their locations.
	$main_menu = get_term_by( 'name', 'Main Menu', 'nav_menu' );

	set_theme_mod( 'nav_menu_locations', array(
			'main-menu' => $main_menu->term_id, // replace 'main-menu' here with the menu location identifier from register_nav_menu() function
		)
	);

	// Assign front page and posts page (blog page).
	$front_page_id = get_page_by_title( 'Home' );
	$blog_page_id  = get_page_by_title( 'Blog' );

	update_option( 'show_on_front', 'page' );
	update_option( 'page_on_front', $front_page_id->ID );
	update_option( 'page_for_posts', $blog_page_id->ID );

}
add_action( 'ocdi/after_import', 'ocdi_after_import_setup' );
`

= What about using local import files (from theme folder)? =

You have to use the same filter as in above example, but with a slightly different array keys: `local_*`. The values have to be absolute paths (not URLs) to your import files. To use local import files, that reside in your theme folder, please use the below code. Note: make sure your import files are readable!

`
function ocdi_import_files() {
	return array(
		array(
			'import_file_name'             => 'Demo Import 1',
			'categories'                   => array( 'Category 1', 'Category 2' ),
			'local_import_file'            => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/demo-content.xml',
			'local_import_widget_file'     => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/widgets.json',
			'local_import_customizer_file' => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/customizer.dat',
			'local_import_redux'           => array(
				array(
					'file_path'   => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/redux.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name',
				),
			),
			'import_preview_image_url'     => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/preview_import_image1.jpg',
			'import_notice'                => __( 'After you import this demo, you will have to setup the slider separately.', 'your-textdomain' ),
			'preview_url'                  => 'http://www.your_domain.com/my-demo-1',
		),
		array(
			'import_file_name'             => 'Demo Import 2',
			'categories'                   => array( 'New category', 'Old category' ),
			'local_import_file'            => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/demo-content2.xml',
			'local_import_widget_file'     => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/widgets2.json',
			'local_import_customizer_file' => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/customizer2.dat',
			'local_import_redux'           => array(
				array(
					'file_path'   => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/redux.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name',
				),
				array(
					'file_path'   => trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'ocdi/redux2.json',
					'option_name' => 'redux_option_name_2',
				),
			),
			'import_preview_image_url'     => 'http://www.your_domain.com/ocdi/preview_import_image2.jpg',
			'import_notice'                => __( 'A special note for this import.', 'your-textdomain' ),
			'preview_url'                  => 'http://www.your_domain.com/my-demo-2',
		),
	);
}
add_filter( 'ocdi/import_files', 'ocdi_import_files' );
`

= How to handle different "after import setups" depending on which predefined import was selected? =

This question might be asked by a theme author wanting to implement different after import setups for multiple predefined demo imports. Lets say we have predefined two demo imports with the following names: 'Demo Import 1' and 'Demo Import 2', the code for after import setup would be (using the `ocdi/after_import` filter):

`
function ocdi_after_import( $selected_import ) {
	echo "This will be displayed on all after imports!";

	if ( 'Demo Import 1' === $selected_import['import_file_name'] ) {
		echo "This will be displayed only on after import if user selects Demo Import 1";

		// Set logo in customizer
		set_theme_mod( 'logo_img', get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/images/logo1.png' );
	}
	elseif ( 'Demo Import 2' === $selected_import['import_file_name'] ) {
		echo "This will be displayed only on after import if user selects Demo Import 2";

		// Set logo in customizer
		set_theme_mod( 'logo_img', get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/images/logo2.png' );
	}
}
add_action( 'ocdi/after_import', 'ocdi_after_import' );
`

= Can I add some code before the widgets get imported? =

Of course you can, use the `ocdi/before_widgets_import` action. You can also target different predefined demo imports like in the example above. Here is a simple example code of the `ocdi/before_widgets_import` action:

`
function ocdi_before_widgets_import( $selected_import ) {
	echo "Add your code here that will be executed before the widgets get imported!";
}
add_action( 'ocdi/before_widgets_import', 'ocdi_before_widgets_import' );
`

= How can I import via the WP-CLI? =

In the 2.4.0 version of this plugin we added two WP-CLI commands:

* `wp ocdi list` - Which will list any predefined demo imports currently active theme might have,
* `wp ocdi import` - which has a few options that you can use to import the things you want (content/widgets/customizer/predefined demos). Let's look at these options below.

`wp ocdi import` options:

`wp ocdi import [--content=<file>] [--widgets=<file>] [--customizer=<file>] [--predefined=<index>]`

* `--content=<file>` - will run the content import with the WP import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--widgets=<file>` - will run the widgets import with the widgets import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--customizer=<file>` - will run the customizer settings import with the customizer import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--predefined=<index>` - will run the theme predefined import with the index of the predefined import in the `<index>` parameter (you can use the `wp ocdi list` command to check which index is used for each predefined demo import)

The content, widgets and customizer options can be mixed and used at the same time. If the `predefined` option is set, then it will ignore all other options and import the predefined demo data.

= I'm a theme author and I want to change the plugin intro text, how can I do that? =

You can change the plugin intro text by using the `ocdi/plugin_intro_text` filter:

`
function ocdi_plugin_intro_text( $default_text ) {
	$default_text .= '<div class="ocdi__intro-text">This is a custom text added to this plugin intro text.</div>';

	return $default_text;
}
add_filter( 'ocdi/plugin_intro_text', 'ocdi_plugin_intro_text' );
`

To add some text in a separate "box", you should wrap your text in a div with a class of 'ocdi__intro-text', like in the code example above.

= How to disable generation of smaller images (thumbnails) during the content import =

This will greatly improve the time needed to import the content (images), but only the original sized images will be imported. You can disable it with a filter, so just add this code to your theme function.php file:

`add_filter( 'ocdi/regenerate_thumbnails_in_content_import', '__return_false' );`

= How to change the location, title and other parameters of the plugin page? =

As a theme author you do not like the location of the "Import Demo Data" plugin page in *Appearance -> Import Demo Data*? You can change that with the filter below. Apart from the location, you can also change the title or the page/menu and some other parameters as well.

`
function ocdi_plugin_page_setup( $default_settings ) {
	$default_settings['parent_slug'] = 'themes.php';
	$default_settings['page_title']  = esc_html__( 'One Click Demo Import' , 'one-click-demo-import' );
	$default_settings['menu_title']  = esc_html__( 'Import Demo Data' , 'one-click-demo-import' );
	$default_settings['capability']  = 'import';
	$default_settings['menu_slug']   = 'one-click-demo-import';

	return $default_settings;
}
add_filter( 'ocdi/plugin_page_setup', 'ocdi_plugin_page_setup' );
`

= How to do something before the content import executes? =

In version 2.0.0 there is a new action hook: `ocdi/before_content_import`, which will let you hook before the content import starts. An example of the code would look like this:

`
function ocdi_before_content_import( $selected_import ) {
	if ( 'Demo Import 1' === $selected_import['import_file_name'] ) {
		// Here you can do stuff for the "Demo Import 1" before the content import starts.
		echo "before import 1";
	}
	else {
		// Here you can do stuff for all other imports before the content import starts.
		echo "before import 2";
	}
}
add_action( 'ocdi/before_content_import', 'ocdi_before_content_import' );
`

= How can I enable the `customize_save*` wp action hooks in the customizer import? =

It's easy, just add this to your theme:

`add_action( 'ocdi/enable_wp_customize_save_hooks', '__return_true' );`

This will enable the following WP hooks when importing the customizer data: `customize_save`, `customize_save_*`, `customize_save_after`.

= How can I pass Amazon S3 presigned URL's (temporary links) as external files ? =

If you want to host your import content files on Amazon S3, but you want them to be publicly available, rather through an own API as presigned URL's (which expires) you can use the filter `ocdi/pre_download_import_files` in which you can pass your own URL's, for example:

`
add_filter( 'ocdi/pre_download_import_files', function( $import_file_info ){

	// In this example `get_my_custom_urls` is supposedly making a `wp_remote_get` request, getting the urls from an API server where you're creating the presigned urls, [example here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/s3-presigned-url.html).
	// This request should return an array containing all the 3 links - `import_file_url`, `import_widget_file_url`, `import_customizer_file_url`
	$request = get_my_custom_urls( $import_file_info );

	if ( !is_wp_error( $request ) )
	{
		if ( isset($request['data']) && is_array($request['data']) )
		{
			if( isset($request['data']['import_file_url']) && $import_file_url = $request['data']['import_file_url'] ){
				$import_file_info['import_file_url'] = $import_file_url;
			}
			if( isset($request['data']['import_widget_file_url']) && $import_widget_file_url = $request['data']['import_widget_file_url'] ){
				$import_file_info['import_widget_file_url'] = $import_widget_file_url;
			}
			if( isset($request['data']['import_customizer_file_url']) && $import_customizer_file_url = $request['data']['import_customizer_file_url'] ){
				$import_file_info['import_customizer_file_url'] = $import_customizer_file_url;
			}
		}
	}

	return $import_file_info;

} );
`

= I can't activate the plugin, because of a fatal error, what can I do? =

*Update: since version 1.2.0, there is now a admin error notice, stating that the minimal PHP version required for this plugin is 5.3.2.*

You want to activate the plugin, but this error shows up:

*Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error*

This happens, because your hosting server is using a very old version of PHP. This plugin requires PHP version of at least **5.3.x**, but we recommend version *5.6.x* or better yet *7.x*. Please contact your hosting company and ask them to update the PHP version for your site.

= Issues with the import, that we can't fix in the plugin =

Please visit this [docs page](https://github.com/awesomemotive/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md), for more answers to issues with importing data.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of multiple predefined demo imports, that a user can choose from.
2. How the import page looks like, when only one demo import is predefined.
3. Example of how the import page looks like, when no demo imports are predefined a.k.a manual import.
4. How the Recommended & Required theme plugins step looks like, just before the import step.
